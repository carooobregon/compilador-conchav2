# Compilador Concha
'Concha' language is a high-level programming language that can be used for object oriented programming. The main characteristic of this language is that the syntax expressions are in spanish so that any spanish speaker can understand and learn the language.

## Main Objective
Democratize the process of learning a programming language by removing the language barrier as most popular programming languages use english words for their syntax.

## Primer avance
In this first revision we implemented the Lexical/Syntactical analysis of our language, introducing the Tokens and Grammar used to parse the syntax of any program written in Concha in the file 'concha.py' . Additionally, the railroad diagrams are attached in this repository that display graphically the BNF grammar we designed for our programming language.

## Segundo avance
In this second revision we implemented the function directory as well as the symbol table used to identify variables written in the language. We used Transformer interface from Lark library to generate an AST from the syntax that will be compiled.

## Tercer avance
In this third revision we changed the library we were using from Lark to rPLY so that we would be able to follow with the course materials. We translated everything we previously had in our previous files so that they would work with rPLY, it was hard work but we believe it's a good step forward for next revisions.

## Cuarto avance
In this revision we refactored the symbol table so that it met our grammar needs. Implemented the final verison of semantic cube along with a few util functions to help the parsing process. We implemented a quadruples class that can handle complex oeprations including par√©ntesis and boolean operations.
 We started implementing the generation of intermediate code for cycles and condiditionals but haven't completely finished. We are working on solving a few bugs so that this works as it is expected to. We are proud of this revision since we are now on schedule with the class and will start preparing for the next deliverable which will include memory management.

## Example of program written in Concha
```python

vacio funcion hola(entero k)!
vacio funcion holaqueonda(entero k,entero j)!

programa miPrimerPrograma
{    
     entero a;
     entero b = 2;
     entero c = a;
     entero d = a + 2 + 1 + (3 / 4 * 3);
     escribir("Hola mundo!");
};

vacio funcion hola(entero k){
     entero l;
     entero a = 1;
     entero b = 2;
     flotante h = 9 + 8 - 1;
};

vacio funcion holaqueonda(entero k,entero j){
     entero l;
     entero a = 1;
     entero b = 2;
     flotante h = 9 + 8 - 1;
};
